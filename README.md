# Description

A Windows forms application that attempts to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using two variations of the Genetic Algorithm.

# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The Travelling Salesman Problem is an algorithmic problem that  asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the 
distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin
city?" 

In this application, the number of cities is 50 and the maximum distance between one city to another is 25.

# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm is an optimization technique that derives inspiration from human evolution. 

Its basic premise is as follows: 

1. Firstly, an initial population is defined.
2. Then a function is defined to classify whether the each member of the population is good or bad.
3. Then the good members are selected for mating to produce offsprings.
4. Finally, these offsprings replace the bad members of the population and this process repeats.
